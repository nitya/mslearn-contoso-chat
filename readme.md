# Build Contoso Chat E2E with Azure AI Studio : Guided Projects

This repo contains the instructions and assets required to support a hands-on workshop or training session to build Contoso Chat - an end-to-end custom copilot application using Azure AI Studio and Prompt flow.

The content is structured as a series of **Guided Project** modules using the Microsoft Learn format for convenience. Guided projects focus help you build a solution to a real-world scenario, step-by-step. Each module is designed to be completed in a single session (30 mins), building on the previous module.


## 1 | Introduction

The workshop targets a real-world application, a customer service chat AI ([Contoso Chat](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat)) that implements a **conversational Q&A chatbot** experience for customers visiting their [Contoso Outdoors](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-web) website.

## 3 | Guided Projects

A _guided project_ is a learning module that guides you through a solution to a real-world use case or challenge. The module format typically involves a _preparation_ step (setup) followed a sequence of _exercises_ (tasks) to build that solution block-by-block. This workshop involves **four** guided projects:

| Project Goal | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Setup](./project-1/README.md) | Provision app resources with Azure AI Studio |
| [Ideation](./project-2/README.md) | Build custom copilot function with Prompt flow |
| [Iteration](./project-3/README.md) | Evaluate custom copilot for Responsible AI |
| [Operationalization:](./project-4/README.md) | Deploy copilot API, integrate with chat UI app |
